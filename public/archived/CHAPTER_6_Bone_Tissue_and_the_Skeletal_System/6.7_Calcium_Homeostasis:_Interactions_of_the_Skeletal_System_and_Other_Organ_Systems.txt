6.7 Calcium Homeostasis: Interactions of the Skeletal System and Other
Organ Systems
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•
Describe the effect of too much or too little calcium on the body
•
Explain the process of calcium homeostasis
Calcium is not only the most abundant mineral in bone, it is also the most abundant mineral in the human body.
Calcium ions are needed not only for bone mineralization but for tooth health, regulation of the heart rate and
strength of contraction, blood coagulation, contraction of smooth and skeletal muscle cells, and regulation of nerve
impulse conduction. The normal level of calcium in the blood is about 10 mg/dL. When the body cannot maintain
this level, a person will experience hypo- or hypercalcemia.
Hypocalcemia, a condition characterized by abnormally low levels of calcium, can have an adverse effect on a
number of different body systems including circulation, muscles, nerves, and bone. Without adequate calcium,
blood has difficulty coagulating, the heart may skip beats or stop beating altogether, muscles may have difficulty
contracting, nerves may have difficulty functioning, and bones may become brittle. The causes of hypocalcemia can
range from hormonal imbalances to an improper diet. Treatments vary according to the cause, but prognoses are
generally good.
Conversely, in hypercalcemia, a condition characterized by abnormally high levels of calcium, the nervous system is
underactive, which results in lethargy, sluggish reflexes, constipation and loss of appetite, confusion, and in severe
cases, coma.
Obviously, calcium homeostasis is critical. The skeletal, endocrine, and digestive systems play a role in this, but the
kidneys do, too. These body systems work together to maintain a normal calcium level in the blood (Figure 6.24).
