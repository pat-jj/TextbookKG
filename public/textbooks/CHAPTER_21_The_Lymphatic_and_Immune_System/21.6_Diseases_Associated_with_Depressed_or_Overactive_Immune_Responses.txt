This section is about how the immune system goes wrong. When it goes haywire, and becomes too weak or too
strong, it leads to a state of disease. The factors that maintain immunological homeostasis are complex and
incompletely understood.

Immunodeficiencies
As you have seen, the immune system is quite complex. It has many pathways using many cell types and signals.
Because it is so complex, there are many ways for it to go wrong. Inherited immunodeficiencies arise from gene
mutations that affect specific components of the immune response. There are also acquired immunodeficiencies
with potentially devastating effects on the immune system, such as HIV.

Inherited Immunodeficiencies
A list of all inherited immunodeficiencies is well beyond the scope of this book. The list is almost as long as the list
of cells, proteins, and signaling molecules of the immune system itself. Some deficiencies, such as those for
complement, cause only a higher susceptibility to some Gram-negative bacteria. Others are more severe in their
consequences. Certainly, the most serious of the inherited immunodeficiencies is severe combined
immunodeficiency disease (SCID). This disease is complex because it is caused by many different genetic defects.
What groups them together is the fact that both the B cell and T cell arms of the adaptive immune response are
affected.
Children with this disease usually die of opportunistic infections within their first year of life unless they receive a
bone marrow transplant. Such a procedure had not yet been perfected for David Vetter, the “boy in the bubble,” who
was treated for SCID by having to live almost his entire life in a sterile plastic cocoon for the 12 years before his
death from infection in 1984. One of the features that make bone marrow transplants work as well as they do is the
proliferative capability of hematopoietic stem cells of the bone marrow. Only a small amount of bone marrow from a
healthy donor is given intravenously to the recipient. It finds its own way to the bone where it populates it,
eventually reconstituting the patient’s immune system, which is usually destroyed beforehand by treatment with
radiation or chemotherapeutic drugs.
New treatments for SCID using gene therapy, inserting nondefective genes into cells taken from the patient and
giving them back, have the advantage of not needing the tissue match required for standard transplants. Although
not a standard treatment, this approach holds promise, especially for those in whom standard bone marrow
transplantation has failed.

Human Immunodeficiency Virus/AIDS
Although many viruses cause suppression of the immune system, only one wipes it out completely, and that is the
previously mentioned HIV. It is worth discussing the biology of this virus, which can lead to the well-known AIDS, so
that its full effects on the immune system can be understood. The virus is transmitted through semen, vaginal fluids,
and blood, and can be caught by risky sexual behaviors and the sharing of needles by intravenous drug users. There
are sometimes, but not always, flu-like symptoms in the first 1 to 2 weeks after infection. This is later followed by
seroconversion. The anti-HIV antibodies formed during seroconversion are the basis for most initial HIV screening
done in the United States. Because seroconversion takes different lengths of time in different individuals, multiple
AIDS tests are given months apart to confirm or eliminate the possibility of infection.
After seroconversion, the amount of virus circulating in the blood drops and stays at a low level for several years.
During this time, the levels of CD4+ cells, especially helper T cells, decline steadily, until at some point, the immune
response is so weak that opportunistic disease and eventually death result. HIV uses CD4 as the receptor to get
inside cells, but it also needs a co-receptor, such as CCR5 or CXCR4. These co-receptors, which usually bind to
chemokines, present another target for anti-HIV drug development. Although other antigen-presenting cells are
infected with HIV, given that CD4+ helper T cells play an important role in T cell immune responses and antibody
responses, it should be no surprise that both types of immune responses are eventually seriously compromised.
Treatment for the disease consists of drugs that target virally encoded proteins that are necessary for viral
replication but are absent from normal human cells. By targeting the virus itself and sparing the cells, this approach
has been successful in significantly prolonging the lives of HIV-positive individuals. On the other hand, an HIV
vaccine has been 30 years in development and is still years away. Because the virus mutates rapidly to evade the
immune system, scientists have been looking for parts of the virus that do not change and thus would be good
targets for a vaccine candidate.

Hypersensitivities
The word “hypersensitivity” simply means sensitive beyond normal levels of activation. Allergies and inflammatory
responses to nonpathogenic environmental substances have been observed since the dawn of history.
Hypersensitivity is a medical term describing symptoms that are now known to be caused by unrelated mechanisms
of immunity. Still, it is useful for this discussion to use the four types of hypersensitivities as a guide to understand
these mechanisms (Figure 21.28).

FIGURE 21.28
Immune Hypersensitivity
Components of the immune system cause four types of hypersensitivity. Notice that types
I–III are B cell mediated, whereas type IV hypersensitivity is exclusively a T cell phenomenon.

Immediate (Type I) Hypersensitivity
Antigens that cause allergic responses are often referred to as allergens. The specificity of the immediate
hypersensitivity response is predicated on the binding of allergen-specific IgE to the mast cell surface. The process
of producing allergen-specific IgE is called sensitization, and is a necessary prerequisite for the symptoms of
immediate hypersensitivity to occur. Allergies and allergic asthma are mediated by mast cell degranulation that is
caused by the crosslinking of the antigen-specific IgE molecules on the mast cell surface. The mediators released
have various vasoactive effects already discussed, but the major symptoms of inhaled allergens are the nasal edema
and runny nose caused by the increased vascular permeability and increased blood flow of nasal blood vessels. As
these mediators are released with mast cell degranulation, type I hypersensitivity reactions are usually rapid and
occur within just a few minutes, hence the term immediate hypersensitivity.
Most allergens are in themselves nonpathogenic and therefore innocuous. Some individuals develop mild allergies,
which are usually treated with antihistamines. Others develop severe allergies that may cause anaphylactic shock,
which can potentially be fatal within 20 to 30 minutes if untreated. This drop in blood pressure (shock) with
accompanying contractions of bronchial smooth muscle is caused by systemic mast cell degranulation when an
allergen is eaten (for example, shellfish and peanuts), injected (by a bee sting or being administered penicillin), or
inhaled (asthma). Because epinephrine raises blood pressure and relaxes bronchial smooth muscle, it is routinely
used to counteract the effects of anaphylaxis and can be lifesaving. Patients with known severe allergies are
encouraged to keep automatic epinephrine injectors with them at all times, especially when away from easy access
to hospitals.
Allergists use skin testing to identify allergens in type I hypersensitivity. In skin testing, allergen extracts are
injected into the epidermis, and a positive result of a soft, pale swelling at the site surrounded by a red zone (called
the wheal and flare response), caused by the release of histamine and the granule mediators, usually occurs within
30 minutes. The soft center is due to fluid leaking from the blood vessels and the redness is caused by the increased
blood flow to the area that results from the dilation of local blood vessels at the site.

Type II and Type III Hypersensitivities
Type II hypersensitivity, which involves IgG-mediated lysis of cells by complement proteins, occurs during
mismatched blood transfusions and blood compatibility diseases such as erythroblastosis fetalis (see section on
transplantation). Type III hypersensitivity occurs with diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus, where
soluble antigens, mostly DNA and other material from the nucleus, and antibodies accumulate in the blood to the
point that the antigen and antibody precipitate along blood vessel linings. These immune complexes often lodge in
the kidneys, joints, and other organs where they can activate complement proteins and cause inflammation.

Delayed (Type IV) Hypersensitivity
Delayed hypersensitivity, or type IV hypersensitivity, is basically a standard cellular immune response. In delayed
hypersensitivity, the first exposure to an antigen is called sensitization, such that on re-exposure, a secondary
cellular response results, secreting cytokines that recruit macrophages and other phagocytes to the site. These
sensitized T cells, of the Th1 class, will also activate cytotoxic T cells. The time it takes for this reaction to occur
accounts for the 24- to 72-hour delay in development.
The classical test for delayed hypersensitivity is the tuberculin test for tuberculosis, where bacterial proteins from
M. tuberculosis are injected into the skin. A couple of days later, a positive test is indicated by a raised red area that
is hard to the touch, called an induration, which is a consequence of the cellular infiltrate, an accumulation of
activated macrophages. A positive tuberculin test means that the patient has been exposed to the bacteria and
exhibits a cellular immune response to it.
Another type of delayed hypersensitivity is contact sensitivity, where substances such as the metal nickel cause a
red and swollen area upon contact with the skin. The individual must have been previously sensitized to the metal. A
much more severe case of contact sensitivity is poison ivy, but many of the harshest symptoms of the reaction are
associated with the toxicity of its oils and are not T cell mediated.

Autoimmune Responses
The worst cases of the immune system over-reacting are autoimmune diseases. Somehow, tolerance breaks down
and the immune systems in individuals with these diseases begin to attack their own bodies, causing significant
damage. The trigger for these diseases is, more often than not, unknown, and the treatments are usually based on
resolving the symptoms using immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory drugs such as steroids. These diseases
can be localized and crippling, as in rheumatoid arthritis, or diffuse in the body with multiple symptoms that differ in
different individuals, as is the case with systemic lupus erythematosus (Figure 21.29).

Autoimmune Disorders: Rheumatoid Arthritis and Lupus

arthritis sufferer is shown in the x-ray. (b) The diagram shows a variety of possible symptoms of systemic lupus erythematosus.

Environmental triggers seem to play large roles in autoimmune responses. One explanation for the breakdown of
tolerance is that, after certain bacterial infections, an immune response to a component of the bacterium cross-
reacts with a self-antigen. This mechanism is seen in rheumatic fever, a result of infection with Streptococcus
bacteria, which causes strep throat. The antibodies to this pathogen’s M protein cross-react with an antigenic
component of heart myosin, a major contractile protein of the heart that is critical to its normal function. The
antibody binds to these molecules and activates complement proteins, causing damage to the heart, especially to
the heart valves. On the other hand, some theories propose that having multiple common infectious diseases
actually prevents autoimmune responses. The fact that autoimmune diseases are rare in countries that have a high
incidence of infectious diseases supports this idea, another example of the hygiene hypothesis discussed earlier in
this chapter.
There are genetic factors in autoimmune diseases as well. Some diseases are associated with the MHC genes that
an individual expresses. The reason for this association is likely because if one’s MHC molecules are not able to
present a certain self-antigen, then that particular autoimmune disease cannot occur. Overall, there are more than
80 different autoimmune diseases, which are a significant health problem in the elderly. Table 21.7 lists several of
the most common autoimmune diseases, the antigens that are targeted, and the segment of the adaptive immune
response that causes the damage.
