24.7 Nutrition and Diet
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•
Explain how different foods can affect metabolism
•
Describe a healthy diet, as recommended by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)
•
List reasons why vitamins and minerals are critical to a healthy diet
The carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins in the foods you eat are used for energy to power molecular, cellular, and
organ system activities. Importantly, the energy is stored primarily as fats. The quantity and quality of food that is
ingested, digested, and absorbed affects the amount of fat that is stored as excess calories. Diet—both what you eat
and how much you eat—has a dramatic impact on your health. Eating too much or too little food can lead to serious
medical issues, including cardiovascular disease, cancer, anorexia, and diabetes, among others. Combine an
unhealthy diet with unhealthy environmental conditions, such as smoking, and the potential medical complications
increase significantly.

Food and Metabolism
The amount of energy that is needed or ingested per day is measured in calories. The nutritional Calorie (C) is the
amount of heat it takes to raise 1 kg (1000 g) of water by 1 °C. This is different from the calorie (c) used in the
physical sciences, which is the amount of heat it takes to raise 1 g of water by 1 °C. When we refer to "calorie," we
are referring to the nutritional Calorie.
On average, a person needs 1500 to 2000 calories per day to sustain (or carry out) daily activities. The total number
of calories needed by one person is dependent on their body mass, age, height, gender, activity level, and the
amount of exercise per day. If exercise is regular part of one’s day, more calories are required. As a rule, people
underestimate the number of calories ingested and overestimate the amount they burn through exercise. This can
lead to ingestion of too many calories per day. The accumulation of an extra 3500 calories adds one pound of
weight. If an excess of 200 calories per day is ingested, one extra pound of body weight will be gained every 18
days. At that rate, an extra 20 pounds can be gained over the course of a year. Of course, this increase in calories
could be offset by increased exercise. Running or jogging one mile burns almost 100 calories.
The type of food ingested also affects the body’s metabolic rate. Processing of carbohydrates requires less energy
than processing of proteins. In fact, the breakdown of carbohydrates requires the least amount of energy, whereas
the processing of proteins demands the most energy. In general, the amount of calories ingested and the amount of
calories burned determines the overall weight. To lose weight, the number of calories burned per day must exceed
the number ingested. Calories are in almost everything you ingest, so when considering calorie intake, beverages
must also be considered.
To help provide guidelines regarding the types and quantities of food that should be eaten every day, the USDA has
updated their food guidelines from MyPyramid to MyPlate. They have put the recommended elements of a healthy
meal into the context of a place setting of food. MyPlate categorizes food into the standard six food groups: fruits,
vegetables, grains, protein foods, dairy, and oils. The accompanying website gives clear recommendations regarding
quantity and type of each food that you should consume each day, as well as identifying which foods belong in each
category. The accompanying graphic (Figure 24.24) gives a clear visual with general recommendations for a healthy
and balanced meal. The guidelines recommend to “Make half your plate fruits and vegetables.” The other half is
grains and protein, with a slightly higher quantity of grains than protein. Dairy products are represented by a drink,
but the quantity can be applied to other dairy products as well.

MyPlate
The U.S. Department of Agriculture developed food guidelines called MyPlate to help demonstrate how to
maintain a healthy lifestyle.

ChooseMyPlate.gov provides extensive online resources for planning a healthy diet and lifestyle, including offering
weight management tips and recommendations for physical activity. It also includes the SuperTracker, a web-based
application to help you analyze your own diet and physical activity.

Vitamins
Vitamins are organic compounds found in foods and are a necessary part of the biochemical reactions in the body.
They are involved in a number of processes, including mineral and bone metabolism, and cell and tissue growth, and
they act as cofactors for energy metabolism. The B vitamins play the largest role of any vitamins in metabolism
(Table 24.3 and Table 24.4).
You get most of your vitamins through your diet, although some can be formed from the precursors absorbed during
digestion. For example, the body synthesizes vitamin A from the β-carotene in orange vegetables like carrots and
sweet potatoes. Vitamins are either fat-soluble or water-soluble. Fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K, are absorbed
through the intestinal tract with lipids in chylomicrons. Vitamin D is also synthesized in the skin through exposure to
sunlight. Because they are carried in lipids, fat-soluble vitamins can accumulate in the lipids stored in the body. If
excess vitamins are retained in the lipid stores in the body, hypervitaminosis can result.
Water-soluble vitamins, including the eight B vitamins and vitamin C, are absorbed with water in the gastrointestinal
tract. These vitamins move easily through bodily fluids, which are water based, so they are not stored in the body.
Excess water-soluble vitamins are excreted in the urine. Therefore, hypervitaminosis of water-soluble vitamins
rarely occurs, except with an excess of vitamin supplements.

Everyday Connection
Metabolism and Obesity
Obesity in the United States is epidemic. The rate of obesity has been steadily rising since the 1980s. In the
1990s, most states reported that less than 10 percent of their populations was obese, and the state with the
highest rate reported that only 15 percent of their population was considered obese. By 2010, the U.S. Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention reported that nearly 36 percent of adults over 20 years old were obese and
an additional 33 percent were overweight, leaving only about 30 percent of the population at a healthy weight.
These studies find the highest levels of obesity are concentrated in the southern states. They also find the level
of childhood obesity is rising.
Obesity is defined by the body mass index (BMI), which is a measure of a person's weight in kilograms divided
by height in meters squared. The normal, or healthy, BMI range is between 18 and 24.9 kg/m2. Overweight is
defined as a BMI of 25 to 29.9 kg/m2, and obesity is considered to be a BMI greater than 30 kg/m2. Obesity can
arise from a number of factors, including overeating, poor diet, sedentary lifestyle, limited sleep, genetic factors,
and even diseases or drugs. Severe obesity (morbid obesity) or long-term obesity can result in serious medical
conditions, including coronary heart disease; type 2 diabetes; endometrial, breast, or colon cancer;
hypertension (high blood pressure); dyslipidemia (high cholesterol or elevated triglycerides); stroke; liver
disease; gall bladder disease; sleep apnea or respiratory diseases; osteoarthritis; and infertility. Research has
shown that losing weight can help reduce or reverse the complications associated with these conditions.

Minerals
Minerals in food are inorganic compounds that work with other nutrients to ensure the body functions properly.
Minerals cannot be made in the body; they come from the diet. The amount of minerals in the body is small—only 4
percent of the total body mass—and most of that consists of the minerals that the body requires in moderate
quantities: potassium, sodium, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, and chloride.
The most common minerals in the body are calcium and phosphorous, both of which are stored in the skeleton and
necessary for the hardening of bones. Most minerals are ionized, and their ionic forms are used in physiological
processes throughout the body. Sodium and chloride ions are electrolytes in the blood and extracellular tissues, and
iron ions are critical to the formation of hemoglobin. There are additional trace minerals that are still important to
the body’s functions, but their required quantities are much lower.
Like vitamins, minerals can be consumed in toxic quantities (although it is rare). A healthy diet includes most of the
minerals your body requires, so supplements and processed foods can add potentially toxic levels of minerals. Table
24.5 and Table 24.6 provide a summary of minerals and their function in the body.
