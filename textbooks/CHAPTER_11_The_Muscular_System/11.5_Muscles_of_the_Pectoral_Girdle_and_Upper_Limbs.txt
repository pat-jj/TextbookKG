Muscles of the Perineum Common to All Humans
11.5 Muscles of the Pectoral Girdle and Upper Limbs
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•
Identify the muscles of the pectoral girdle and upper limbs
•
Identify the movement and function of the pectoral girdle and upper limbs
Muscles of the shoulder and upper limb can be divided into four groups: muscles that stabilize and position the
pectoral girdle, muscles that move the arm, muscles that move the forearm, and muscles that move the wrists,
hands, and fingers. The pectoral girdle, or shoulder girdle, consists of the lateral ends of the clavicle and scapula,
along with the proximal end of the humerus, and the muscles covering these three bones to stabilize the shoulder
joint. The girdle creates a base from which the head of the humerus, in its ball-and-socket joint with the glenoid
fossa of the scapula, can move the arm in multiple directions.
Muscles That Position the Pectoral Girdle
Muscles that position the pectoral girdle are located either on the anterior thorax or on the posterior thorax (Figure
11.22 and Table 11.8). The anterior muscles include the subclavius, pectoralis minor, and serratus anterior. The
posterior muscles include the trapezius, rhomboid major, and rhomboid minor. When the rhomboids are
contracted, your scapula moves medially, which can pull the shoulder and upper limb posteriorly.

FIGURE 11.22
Muscles That Position the Pectoral Girdle
The muscles that stabilize the pectoral girdle make it a steady base on
which other muscles can move the arm. Note that the pectoralis major and deltoid, which move the humerus, are cut here to show the
deeper positioning muscles.

Muscles That Move the Humerus
Similar to the muscles that position the pectoral girdle, muscles that cross the shoulder joint and move the humerus
bone of the arm include both axial and scapular muscles (Figure 11.23 and Figure 11.24). The two axial muscles are
the pectoralis major and the latissimus dorsi. The pectoralis major is thick and fan-shaped, covering much of the
superior portion of the anterior thorax. The broad, triangular latissimus dorsi is located on the inferior part of the
back, where it inserts into a thick connective tissue sheath called an aponeurosis.

FIGURE 11.23
Muscles That Move the Humerus
(a, c) The muscles that move the humerus anteriorly are generally located on the
anterior side of the body and originate from the sternum (e.g., pectoralis major) or the anterior side of the scapula (e.g., subscapularis). (b)
The muscles that move the humerus superiorly generally originate from the superior surfaces of the scapula and/or the clavicle (e.g.,
deltoids). The muscles that move the humerus inferiorly generally originate from middle or lower back (e.g., latissiumus dorsi). (d) The
muscles that move the humerus posteriorly are generally located on the posterior side of the body and insert into the scapula (e.g.,
infraspinatus).

FIGURE 11.24
Muscles That Move the Humerus
The rest of the shoulder muscles originate on the scapula. The anatomical and ligamental structure of the shoulder
joint and the arrangements of the muscles covering it, allows the arm to carry out different types of movements. The
deltoid, the thick muscle that creates the rounded lines of the shoulder is the major abductor of the arm, but it also
facilitates flexing and medial rotation, as well as extension and lateral rotation. The subscapularis originates on the
anterior scapula and medially rotates the arm. Named for their locations, the supraspinatus (superior to the spine
of the scapula) and the infraspinatus (inferior to the spine of the scapula) abduct the arm, and laterally rotate the
arm, respectively. The thick and flat teres major is inferior to the teres minor and extends the arm, and assists in
adduction and medial rotation of it. The long teres minor laterally rotates and extends the arm. Finally, the
coracobrachialis flexes and adducts the arm.
The tendons of the deep subscapularis, supraspinatus, infraspinatus, and teres minor connect the scapula to the
humerus, forming the rotator cuff (musculotendinous cuff), the circle of tendons around the shoulder joint. When
baseball pitchers undergo shoulder surgery it is usually on the rotator cuff, which becomes pinched and inflamed,
and may tear away from the bone due to the repetitive motion of bring the arm overhead to throw a fast pitch.
Muscles That Move the Forearm
The forearm, made of the radius and ulna bones, has four main types of action at the hinge of the elbow joint:

flexion, extension, pronation, and supination. The forearm flexors include the biceps brachii, brachialis, and
brachioradialis. The extensors are the triceps brachii and anconeus. The pronators are the pronator teres and the
pronator quadratus, and the supinator is the only one that turns the forearm anteriorly. When the forearm faces
anteriorly, it is supinated. When the forearm faces posteriorly, it is pronated.
The biceps brachii, brachialis, and brachioradialis flex the forearm. The two-headed biceps brachii crosses the
shoulder and elbow joints to flex the forearm, also taking part in supinating the forearm at the radioulnar joints and
flexing the arm at the shoulder joint. Deep to the biceps brachii, the brachialis provides additional power in flexing
the forearm. Finally, the brachioradialis can flex the forearm quickly or help lift a load slowly. These muscles and
their associated blood vessels and nerves form the anterior compartment of the arm (anterior flexor compartment
of the arm) (Figure 11.25 and Figure 11.26).

FIGURE 11.25
Muscles That Move the Forearm
The muscles originating in the upper arm flex, extend, pronate, and supinate the
forearm. The muscles originating in the forearm move the wrists, hands, and fingers.

FIGURE 11.26
Muscles That Move the Forearm
Muscles That Move the Wrist, Hand, and Fingers
Wrist, hand, and finger movements are facilitated by two groups of muscles. The forearm is the origin of the
extrinsic muscles of the hand. The palm is the origin of the intrinsic muscles of the hand.
Muscles of the Arm That Move the Wrists, Hands, and Fingers
The muscles in the anterior compartment of the forearm (anterior flexor compartment of the forearm) originate on
the humerus and insert onto different parts of the hand. These make up the bulk of the forearm. From lateral to
medial, the superficial anterior compartment of the forearm includes the flexor carpi radialis, palmaris longus,
flexor carpi ulnaris, and flexor digitorum superficialis. The flexor digitorum superficialis flexes the hand as well as
the digits at the knuckles, which allows for rapid finger movements, as in typing or playing a musical instrument (see
Figure 11.27 and Table 11.9). However, poor ergonomics can irritate the tendons of these muscles as they slide
back and forth with the carpal tunnel of the anterior wrist and pinch the median nerve, which also travels through
the tunnel, causing Carpal Tunnel Syndrome. The deep anterior compartment produces flexion and bends fingers
to make a fist. These are the flexor pollicis longus and the flexor digitorum profundus.
The muscles in the superficial posterior compartment of the forearm (superficial posterior extensor compartment
of the forearm) originate on the humerus. These are the extensor radialis longus, extensor carpi radialis brevis,
extensor digitorum, extensor digiti minimi, and the extensor carpi ulnaris.
The muscles of the deep posterior compartment of the forearm (deep posterior extensor compartment of the
forearm) originate on the radius and ulna. These include the abductor pollicis longus, extensor pollicis brevis,
extensor pollicis longus, and extensor indicis (see Figure 11.27).
FIGURE 11.27
Muscles That Move the Wrist, Hands, and Forearm
The tendons of the forearm muscles attach to the wrist and extend into the hand. Fibrous bands called retinacula
sheath the tendons at the wrist. The flexor retinaculum extends over the palmar surface of the hand while the
extensor retinaculum extends over the dorsal surface of the hand.
Intrinsic Muscles of the Hand
The intrinsic muscles of the hand both originate and insert within it (Figure 11.28). These muscles allow your
fingers to also make precise movements for actions, such as typing or writing. These muscles are divided into three
groups. The thenar muscles are on the radial aspect of the palm. The hypothenar muscles are on the medial aspect
of the palm, and the intermediate muscles are midpalmar.
The thenar muscles include the abductor pollicis brevis, opponens pollicis, flexor pollicis brevis, and the
adductor pollicis. These muscles form the thenar eminence, the rounded contour of the base of the thumb, and all
act on the thumb. The movements of the thumb play an integral role in most precise movements of the hand.
The hypothenar muscles include the abductor digiti minimi, flexor digiti minimi brevis, and the opponens digiti
minimi. These muscles form the hypothenar eminence, the rounded contour of the little finger, and as such, they
all act on the little finger. Finally, the intermediate muscles act on all the fingers and include the lumbrical, the
palmar interossei, and the dorsal interossei.
FIGURE 11.28
Intrinsic Muscles of the Hand
The intrinsic muscles of the hand both originate and insert within the hand. These
muscles provide the fine motor control of the fingers by flexing, extending, abducting, and adducting the more distal finger and thumb
segments.
