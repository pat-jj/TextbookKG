INTRODUCTION
CHAPTER 17
The Endocrine System
CHAPTER OBJECTIVES
After studying this chapter, you will be able to:
•
Identify the contributions of the endocrine system to homeostasis
•
Discuss the chemical composition of hormones and the mechanisms of hormone action
•
Summarize the site of production, regulation, and effects of the hormones of the pituitary, thyroid,
parathyroid, adrenal, and pineal glands
•
Discuss the hormonal regulation of the reproductive system
•
Explain the role of the pancreatic endocrine cells in the regulation of blood glucose
•
Identify the hormones released by the heart, kidneys, and other organs with secondary endocrine functions
•
Discuss several common diseases associated with endocrine system dysfunction
•
Discuss the embryonic development of, and the effects of aging on, the endocrine system
You may never have thought of it this way, but when you send a text message to two friends to
meet you at the dining hall at six, you’re sending digital signals that (you hope) will affect their behavior—even
though they are some distance away. Similarly, certain cells send chemical signals to other cells in the body that
influence their behavior. This long-distance intercellular communication, coordination, and control is critical for
homeostasis, and it is the fundamental function of the endocrine system.
17.1 An Overview of the Endocrine System
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•
Distinguish the types of intercellular communication, their importance, mechanisms, and effects
•
Identify the major organs and tissues of the endocrine system and their location in the body
Communication is a process in which a sender transmits signals to one or more receivers to control and coordinate
actions. In the human body, two major organ systems participate in relatively “long distance” communication: the
nervous system and the endocrine system. Together, these two systems are primarily responsible for maintaining

regulation, the stress response, reproduction, and many other functions. (credit: “seenthroughmylense”/flickr.com)
