INTRODUCTION
CHAPTER 18
The Cardiovascular System: Blood
CHAPTER OBJECTIVES
After studying this chapter, you will be able to:
•
Identify the primary functions of blood, its fluid and cellular components, and its physical characteristics
•
Identify the most important proteins and other solutes present in blood plasma
•
Describe the formation of the formed element components of blood
•
Discuss the structure and function of red blood cells and hemoglobin
•
Classify and characterize white blood cells
•
Describe the structure of platelets and explain the process of hemostasis
•
Explain the significance of AB and Rh blood groups in blood transfusions
•
Discuss a variety of blood disorders
Single-celled organisms do not need blood. They obtain nutrients directly from and excrete
wastes directly into their environment. The human organism cannot do that. Our large, complex bodies need blood
to deliver nutrients to and remove wastes from our trillions of cells. The heart pumps blood throughout the body in a
network of blood vessels. Together, these three components—blood, heart, and vessels—makes up the
cardiovascular system. This chapter focuses on the medium of transport: blood.
18.1 An Overview of Blood
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•
Identify the primary functions of blood in transportation, defense, and maintenance of homeostasis
•
Name the fluid component of blood and the three major types of formed elements, and identify their relative
proportions in a blood sample
•
Discuss the unique physical characteristics of blood
•
Identify the composition of blood plasma, including its most important solutes and plasma proteins
Recall that blood is a connective tissue. Like all connective tissues, it is made up of cellular elements and an
