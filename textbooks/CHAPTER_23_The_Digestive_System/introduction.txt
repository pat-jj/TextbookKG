INTRODUCTION
CHAPTER 23
The Digestive System
CHAPTER OBJECTIVES
After studying this chapter, you will be able to:
•
List and describe the functional anatomy of the organs and accessory organs of the digestive system
•
Discuss the processes and control of ingestion, propulsion, mechanical digestion, chemical digestion,
absorption, and defecation
•
Discuss the roles of the liver, pancreas, and gallbladder in digestion
•
Compare and contrast the digestion of the three macronutrients
The digestive system is continually at work, yet people seldom appreciate the complex tasks it
performs in a choreographed biologic symphony. Consider what happens when you eat an apple. Of course, you
enjoy the apple’s taste as you chew it, but in the hours that follow, unless something goes amiss and you get a
stomachache, you don’t notice that your digestive system is working. You may be taking a walk or studying or
sleeping, having forgotten all about the apple, but your stomach and intestines are busy digesting it and absorbing
its vitamins and other nutrients. By the time any waste material is excreted, the body has appropriated all it can use
from the apple. In short, whether you pay attention or not, the organs of the digestive system perform their specific
functions, allowing you to use the food you eat to keep you going. This chapter examines the structure and functions
of these organs, and explores the mechanics and chemistry of the digestive processes.
23.1 Overview of the Digestive System
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•
Identify the organs of the alimentary canal from proximal to distal, and briefly state their function
•
Identify the accessory digestive organs and briefly state their function
•
Describe the four fundamental tissue layers of the alimentary canal
•
Contrast the contributions of the enteric and autonomic nervous systems to digestive system functioning
•
Explain how the peritoneum anchors the digestive organs

of many organs. (credit: “Aimanness Photography”/Flickr)
