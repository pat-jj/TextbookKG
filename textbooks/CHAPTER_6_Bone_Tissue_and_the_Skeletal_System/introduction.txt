INTRODUCTION
CHAPTER 6
Bone Tissue and the Skeletal System
CHAPTER OBJECTIVES
After studying this chapter, you will be able to:
•
List and describe the functions of bones
•
Describe the classes of bones
•
Discuss the process of bone formation and development
•
Explain how bone repairs itself after a fracture
•
Discuss the effect of exercise, nutrition, and hormones on bone tissue
•
Describe how an imbalance of calcium can affect bone tissue
Bones make good fossils. While the soft tissue of a once living organism will decay and fall away
over time, bone tissue will, under the right conditions, undergo a process of mineralization, effectively turning the
bone to stone. A well-preserved fossil skeleton can give us a good sense of the size and shape of an organism, just
as your skeleton helps to define your size and shape. Unlike a fossil skeleton, however, your skeleton is a structure
of living tissue that grows, repairs, and renews itself. The bones within it are dynamic and complex organs that serve
a number of important functions, including some necessary to maintain homeostasis.
6.1 The Functions of the Skeletal System
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•
Define bone, cartilage, and the skeletal system
•
List and describe the functions of the skeletal system
Bone, or osseous tissue, is a hard, dense connective tissue that forms most of the adult skeleton, the support
structure of the body. In the areas of the skeleton where bones move (for example, the ribcage and joints),
cartilage, a semi-rigid form of connective tissue, provides flexibility and smooth surfaces for movement. The
skeletal system is the body system composed of bones and cartilage and performs the following critical functions
for the human body:

Child Looking at Bones Bone is a living tissue. Unlike the bones of a fossil made inert by a process of mineralization, a child’s
bones will continue to grow and develop while contributing to the support and function of other body systems. (credit: James Emery)
