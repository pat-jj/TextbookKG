4.5 Nervous Tissue Mediates Perception and Response
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•
Identify the classes of cells that make up nervous tissue
•
Discuss how nervous tissue mediates perception and response
Nervous tissue is characterized as being excitable and capable of sending and receiving electrochemical signals that
provide the body with information. Two main classes of cells make up nervous tissue: the neuron and neuroglia
(Figure 4.19). Neurons propagate information via electrochemical impulses, called action potentials, which are
biochemically linked to the release of chemical signals. Neuroglia play an essential role in supporting neurons and
modulating their information propagation.

The Neuron
The cell body of a neuron, also called the soma, contains the nucleus and mitochondria. The dendrites
transfer the nerve impulse to the soma. The axon carries the action potential away to another excitable cell. LM × 1600. (Micrograph

cell?
Neurons display distinctive morphology, well suited to their role as conducting cells, with three main parts. The cell
body includes most of the cytoplasm, the organelles, and the nucleus. Dendrites branch off the cell body and appear
as thin extensions. A long “tail,” the axon, extends from the neuron body and can be wrapped in an insulating layer
known as myelin, which is formed by accessory cells. The synapse is the gap between nerve cells, or between a
nerve cell and its target, for example, a muscle or a gland, across which the impulse is transmitted by chemical
compounds known as neurotransmitters. Neurons categorized as multipolar neurons have several dendrites and a
single prominent axon. Bipolar neurons possess a single dendrite and axon with the cell body, while unipolar
neurons have only a single process extending out from the cell body, which divides into a functional dendrite and
into a functional axon. When a neuron is sufficiently stimulated, it generates an action potential that propagates
down the axon towards the synapse. If enough neurotransmitters are released at the synapse to stimulate the next
neuron or target, a response is generated.
The second class of neural cells comprises the neuroglia or glial cells, which have been characterized as having a
simple support role. The word “glia” comes from the Greek word for glue. Recent research is shedding light on the
more complex role of neuroglia in the function of the brain and nervous system. Astrocyte cells, named for their
distinctive star shape, are abundant in the central nervous system. The astrocytes have many functions, including
regulation of ion concentration in the intercellular space, uptake and/or breakdown of some neurotransmitters, and
formation of the blood-brain barrier, the membrane that separates the circulatory system from the brain. Microglia
protect the nervous system against infection but are not nervous tissue because they are related to macrophages.
Oligodendrocyte cells produce myelin in the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) while the Schwann cell
produces myelin in the peripheral nervous system (Figure 4.20).
