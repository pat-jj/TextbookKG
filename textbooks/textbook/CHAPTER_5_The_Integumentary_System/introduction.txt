INTRODUCTION
CHAPTER 5
The Integumentary System
CHAPTER OBJECTIVES
After studying the chapter, you will be able to:
•
Describe the integumentary system and the role it plays in homeostasis
•
Describe the layers of the skin and the functions of each layer
•
Describe the accessory structures of the skin and the functions of each
•
Describe the changes that occur in the integumentary system during the aging process
•
Discuss several common diseases, disorders, and injuries that affect the integumentary system
•
Explain treatments for some common diseases, disorders, and injuries of the integumentary system
What do you think when you look at your skin in the mirror? Do you think about covering it with
makeup, adding a tattoo, or maybe a body piercing? Or do you think about the fact that the skin belongs to one of
the body’s most essential and dynamic systems: the integumentary system? The integumentary system refers to the
skin and its accessory structures, and it is responsible for much more than simply lending to your outward
appearance. In the adult human body, the skin makes up about 16 percent of body weight and covers an area of 1.5
to 2 m2. In fact, the skin and accessory structures are the largest organ system in the human body. As such, the skin
protects your inner organs and it is in need of daily care and protection to maintain its health. This chapter will
introduce the structure and functions of the integumentary system, as well as some of the diseases, disorders, and
injuries that can affect this system.
5.1 Layers of the Skin
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•
Identify the components of the integumentary system
•
Describe the layers of the skin and the functions of each layer
•
Identify and describe the hypodermis and deep fascia
•
Describe the role of keratinocytes and their life cycle
•
Describe the role of melanocytes in skin pigmentation
Although you may not typically think of the skin as an organ, it is in fact made of tissues that work together as a
single structure to perform unique and critical functions. The skin and its accessory structures make up the
integumentary system, which provides the body with overall protection. The skin is made of multiple layers of cells
and tissues, which are held to underlying structures by connective tissue (Figure 5.2). The deeper layer of skin is
well vascularized (has numerous blood vessels). It also has numerous sensory, and autonomic and sympathetic
